evora
=====

evora is a hydrodynamic code for the computation of the cosmological evolution of a polytropic fluid including the influence of gravity, primordial chemical processes, radiative cooling, heating by a UV background, and thermal conduction.

The code was developed by Jochen Klar while working on his PhD thesis "A detailed view on filaments and sheets of the warm-hot intergalactic medium". It is is named after the town of Evora, Portugal.v Details about the code can be found in the mentioned PhD thesis, which is publicly available at http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:kobv:517-opus-58038.
